# No Double-Click Guard on Apply Button

## Problem Statement
The Apply button uses `applying.value` signal for disabled state, but there's a theoretical race window before Preact's render cycle propagates the signal update. SSA is idempotent so no data corruption, but a ref-based guard would be cleaner.

## Work Log
- 2026-03-13: Created from PR #14 code review (performance-oracle)
