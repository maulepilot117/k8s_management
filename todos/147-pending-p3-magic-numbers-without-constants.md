# Magic Numbers Without Named Constants

## Problem Statement
Values like 1000 (max replicas), 65535 (max port), 30000/32767 (NodePort range), 20 (max ports), 50 (max env vars), and 1<<20 (max body) are hardcoded independently in backend and frontend without shared constants. Can drift out of sync.

## Work Log
- 2026-03-13: Created from PR #14 code review (pattern-recognition-specialist)
