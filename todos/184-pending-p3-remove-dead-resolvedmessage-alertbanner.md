# Dead resolvedMessage Signal in AlertBanner

## Problem Statement
`resolvedMessage` signal is declared and conditionally rendered in `AlertBanner.tsx` but never set to a non-null value. The rendering branch is unreachable dead code.

## Proposed Solutions
Remove the signal and the dead rendering branch (~8 LOC).
- **Effort**: Small

## Resources
- PR: #17
- File: `frontend/islands/AlertBanner.tsx:15,38-44`
