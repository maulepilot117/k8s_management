# Port Name Not Validated Against IANA Service Name Format

## Problem Statement
Port names are accepted as free-form strings. K8s requires valid IANA service names (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens, max 15 chars, at least one letter). Invalid names will be rejected by k8s API with less user-friendly errors.

## Work Log
- 2026-03-13: Created from PR #14 code review (security-sentinel)
